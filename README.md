# RandomWalk
A class that can model simulations of random walks (see description) in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions

### What is a random walk?

A random walk is a random process in probability theory that models a path from a starting point to an end point given that it can travel any direction within it's dimensions. This can be modeled in one dimension (a number line), two dimensions (a coordinate plane), and 3 dimensions alike.
